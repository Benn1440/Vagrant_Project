With the use of a single Vagrantfile, I provisioned two(2) Virtual Machines.
One VM a web server and the other for a database.
The web server VM used Shell provisioner.
The resource Nginx server VM: memory=1024



Also, Configured the db server VM using Shell provisioner.
The DB Server resource has a VM: memory=2048
Setup a MySQL on your machine

Both Machines were able to communicate with each other on the network.
